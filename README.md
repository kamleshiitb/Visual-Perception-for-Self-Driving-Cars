# Visual-Perception-for-Self-Driving-Cars
 As my mentors suggested to us to do the course on deep learning  beacause my project is  completely based on deep learning and computer vision so right now i am doing on coursera titled as "Neural Networks and Deep Learning" by Andrew Ng.
## my learning so far--
 1. Understanding of  Artificial neural network ( forward and back propagation, gradient decent approach etc..)
 2. understanding of CNN ( convolution, pooling etc..)
 3. understanding of RCNN and basic concept of YOLO
